# Natural Language Database Interface Powered by OpenAI
This project is a simple example of the power of artificial intelligence. With careful instruction, a large language model is told
what database it's working with and how it should respond to user inputs at different points of the program, first being used to
create SQL queries to answer user questions, then to handle errors if the query is ill-formed or the question is impossible to answer,
and finally to turn the results of the process into a natural-language answer to the posed question. The solution is simple and elegant,
and demonstrates basic techniques for leveraging LLMs for user-friendly applications.
